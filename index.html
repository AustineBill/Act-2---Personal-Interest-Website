                <h3>3 IDIOTS</h3>
                <p>Narrated through two parallel dramas, one in the present and the other set ten years in the past, the story follows the friendship of three 
                    students at an Indian engineering college and is a satire about the social pressures under the Indian education system.

                    <p>In real life, the structure of this story reflects the way people often look back on their college years in India. It's a reminder of the 
                        friendships and pressures experienced during that time, and how those experiences continue to shape their lives. It highlights the lasting 
                        impact of education and relationships on individuals as they navigate their careers and personal growth.

                <h3>LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT</h3>
                <p>Love at First Sight: On their flight from New York to London, Hadley and Oliver fall in love with each other.
                    However, they lose each other at customs and the possibility of ever meeting each other again seems improbable,
                    but destiny may have a way of changing the odds.
                </p>
                
                    <p>In my personal life, I haven't experienced a "love at first sight" scenario as dramatic as Hadley and Oliver's,
                        but I have heard stories from friends and family where chance encounters and unexpected connections led to lasting
                        relationships. It reminds me that life is full of surprises, and sometimes, destiny has a way of bringing people
                        back together, even when the odds seem slim.

                <h3>ME BEFORE YOU</h3>
                <p>Louisa Clark is an ordinary girl living an exceedingly ordinary life—steady boyfriend, close family—who has barely been farther 
                    afield than their tiny village. She takes a badly needed job working for ex–Master of the Universe Will Traynor, who is wheelchair 
                    bound after an accident.

                    <p>In real life, the situation described in "Me Before You" could be loosely related to the experiences of individuals who become 
                        caregivers for people with disabilities due to accidents or medical conditions. While specific characters like Louisa and Will 
                        are fictional, the challenges and relationships portrayed in the book reflect real-life scenarios where caregivers and individuals 
                        with disabilities navigate the complexities of their situations, forming unique bonds and facing life-altering decisions.
